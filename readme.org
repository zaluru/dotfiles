#+title: My nix based setup
I used to run gnu Guix for a few months, but got filtered by Guile and switched to Fedora :)


When I find some free time to study, I will definitely try Guix again, it seems to be the best declarative operating system currently available.


But because of the amount of people using nix, sharing their configurations and maintaining packages, I decided to give it a try, and after the short time of using it, I like it.

I was looking for a nixos configuration from hyprland, the first one that caught my eye was [[https://github.com/samiulbasirfahim/nixos][here]]
